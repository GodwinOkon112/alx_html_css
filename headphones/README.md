##Headphones Landing Page

A fully responsive landing page built with HTML and CSS, following best practices in structure, styling, and component reuse. This project is part of the ALX Front-End curriculum and focuses on creating a clean, accessible, and well-organized webpage.


##Project Overview

This project is all about building a webpage the right way by applying strong foundations:

Resetting CSS for consistent styling

Using variables for easy style management

Keeping selectors simple and generic

Avoiding overly specific CSS

Using clean and structured HTML

Building layout from outside → inside and top → bottom

The page is developed section by section, improving and reusing components as the project grows.
